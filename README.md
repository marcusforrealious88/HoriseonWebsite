# HoriseonWebsite

## About

The Horiseon Landing page needs to serve as an easy-to-use platform for client navigation. 

In order to accomplish this the site is reactive and will display all of the necessary content on smaller devices and tablets.

The site is accessible and friendly with alt tags for screen readers.

The HTML and CSS work together to avoid redundancy and conflift.
